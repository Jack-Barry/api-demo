# Docs

## Welcome!

Thanks for stopping by the docs section! It is much appreciated that you are
looking for more details on how to work on this project and keep it nice and
uniform.

Discussion about implementing better tools is strongly encouraged!  We should
always be thinking about whether or not our tooling is ready for the future,
and this set of documents aims to give you insight to the reasons tools were
chosen in the first place so that you have a better grasp of how switching a
tool out might affect the project as a whole.

If you can't find what you're looking for, feel free to ask the repo owner
and/or create a pull request to implement documentation about something!

Cheers
